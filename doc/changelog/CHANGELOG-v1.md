# Release v1.1.0


### :star2: Features

- Loki sink supported, so you can send messages to Loki now. #119

  > eg:
  >
  > ```yaml
  > sink:
  >   type: loki
  >   url: "http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push"
  > ```

- Add spec.interceptors and spec.sink fields in ClusterLogConfig/LogConfig CRD #120

  > eg:
  >
  > ```yaml
  > apiVersion: loggie.io/v1beta1
  > kind: LogConfig
  > metadata:
  >   name: tomcat
  >   namespace: default
  > spec:
  >   selector:
  >     type: pod
  >     labelSelector:
  >       app: tomcat
  >   pipeline:
  >     sources: |
  >       - type: file
  >         name: common
  >         paths:
  >           - stdout
  >     sink: |
  >       type: dev
  >       printEvents: false
  >     interceptors: |
  >       - type: rateLimit
  >         qps: 90000
  > ```

- A new codec type `raw` is added. #137

  > eg:
  >
  > ```yaml
  >     sink:
  >       type: dev
  >       codec:
  >         type: raw
  > ```

- A new approach to external configurations, `-config.from=env`, allows Loggie to read configs from env.  #132 (by @chaunceyjiang)

- Normalize interceptor now support `fmt` processor. This can reformat the fields by patterns. #141

  > eg:
  >
  > ```yaml
  > interceptors:
  > - type: normalize
  >   processors:
  >   - fmt:
  >       fields:
  >         d: new-${a.b}-${c}
  > ```

- Adding `enabled` fields in source/interceptor. #140

- We would flush the pipelines.yml immediately when updating sink/interceptor CR. #139

- Upgraded client-go version to 0.22.2  #99 (by @fengshunli)

- `sniff` are disabled in elasticsearch sink by default. #138

- Updated kubeEvent source #144

  - leader selection support.

  - blacklist of namespaces support.

  - adding `watchLatestEvents` fields, allows Loggie watch the lastest events from K8s.

  > eg:
  >
  > ```yaml
  >       - type: kubeEvent
  >         name: eventer
  >         kubeconfig: ～/.kube/config
  >         watchLatestEvents: true
  >         blackListNamespaces: ["default"]
  > ```

- Brace Expansion：{alt1,...} suppport, matches a sequence of characters if one of the comma-separated alternatives matches.

  > eg:
  >
  > log files following:
  >
  > 1. /tmp/loggie/service/order/access.log
  > 2. /tmp/loggie/service/order/access.log.2022-04-11
  > 3. /tmp/loggie/service/pay/access.log
  > 4. /tmp/loggie/service/pay/access.log.2022-04-11
  >
  > then the path field in filesource could be: /tmp/loggie/**/access.log{,.[2-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[01][0-9]-[0123][0-9]}

- Adding `local` in normalize interceptor, in case we want to parse timestamp with local time.

- We support a simple way to add file state when collecting log files, enable `addonMeta`, then Loggie will add more metadata of files in events.

  > eg:
  >
  > ```json
  > {
  >   "body": "this is test",
  >   "state": {
  >     "pipeline": "local",
  >     "source": "demo",
  >     "filename": "/var/log/a.log",
  >     "timestamp": "2006-01-02T15:04:05.000Z",
  >     "offset": 1024,
  >     "bytes": 4096,
  >     "hostname": "node-1"
  >   }
  > }
  > ```

- Adding `pod.ip`和`node.ip` in K8s discovery.

- Customized `documentId` supported in elasticsearch sink.

### :bug: Bug Fixes

- Fix read chan size error in filesource  #102
- Update default value of `maxAcceptedBytes` in kafka source which may cause panic in component starting. #112
